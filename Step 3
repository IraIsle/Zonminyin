Okay, great! Let's get started. I'm excited to move into the more concrete planning phases.

1. Database Choice:

For this project, I would recommend we start with PostgreSQL. Here's why:

Relational Structure: Your data has a lot of clear relationships (e.g., users to products, products to categories, orders to users), and PostgreSQL is excellent at handling these with foreign keys and relationships.

Maturity and Stability: PostgreSQL is a mature and highly reliable database system.

SQL Proficiency: Learning SQL is a valuable skill, and you'll become more proficient with it using PostgreSQL.

Cloud Support: It has strong support on major cloud platforms with free tiers (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) if we move there later.

2. Initial Data Models

Here are the initial data models for the five core microservices that we will start building, keeping in mind the MVP and focusing on the required fields. Note that these are initial models, we can always add fields later on as we move forward.

User Service:

users table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

username (string, unique, required)

email (string, unique, required)

password (string, required) (we'll hash this)

full_name (string, required)

phone_number (string, can be null)

role (enum, required - client, retailer, artisan, admin)

created_at (timestamp, automatically set)

updated_at (timestamp, automatically set)

Location Service:

markets table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

name (string, unique, required)

latitude (decimal, required)

longitude (decimal, required)

addresses table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

user_id (integer, foreign key referencing users.id, required )

address_line1 (string, required)

address_line2 (string, can be null)

city (string, required)

latitude (decimal, required)

longitude (decimal, required)

Catalog Service:

categories table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

name (string, unique, required)

products table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

name (string, required)

description (text, can be null)

price (decimal, required)

category_id (integer, foreign key referencing categories.id, required)

user_id (integer, foreign key referencing users.id, required)

market_id (integer, foreign key referencing markets.id, can be null )

image_url (string, can be null)

Service Listing Service:

service_categories table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

name (string, unique, required)

service_listings table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

user_id (integer, foreign key referencing users.id, required)

title (string, required)

description (text, can be null)

category_id (integer, foreign key referencing service_categories.id, required)

price (decimal, required)

location (string, can be null) (To be refined later)

image_url (string, can be null)

Chat Service:

chats table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

sender_id (integer, foreign key referencing users.id, required)

receiver_id (integer, foreign key referencing users.id, required)

messages table

id (integer, primary key, auto-incrementing)

chat_id (integer, foreign key referencing chats.id, required)

sender_id (integer, foreign key referencing users.id, required)

message_text (text, required)

sent_at (timestamp, automatically set)

3. API Endpoints (High-Level)

These are very basic endpoints to give you a good starting point for each service:

User Service:

POST /users: Create a new user

GET /users: List all users

GET /users/{id}: Get a user by ID

PUT /users/{id}: Update a user

DELETE /users/{id}: Delete a user

POST /users/login: Login a user

Location Service:

POST /markets: Create a new market

GET /markets: List all markets

GET /markets/{id}: Get a market by ID

PUT /markets/{id}: Update a market

DELETE /markets/{id}: Delete a market

POST /addresses : Create an address

GET /addresses : List all addresses

GET /addresses/{id}: Get an address by ID

PUT /addresses/{id}: Update an address

DELETE /addresses/{id}: Delete an address

Catalog Service:

POST /categories: Create a new category

GET /categories: List all categories

GET /categories/{id}: Get a category by ID

PUT /categories/{id}: Update a category

DELETE /categories/{id}: Delete a category

POST /products: Create a new product

GET /products: List all products

GET /products/{id}: Get a product by ID

PUT /products/{id}: Update a product

DELETE /products/{id}: Delete a product

GET /products/search?query={query}: Search products

Service Listing Service:

POST /service-categories: Create a new service category

GET /service-categories: List all service categories

GET /service-categories/{id}: Get a service category by ID

PUT /service-categories/{id}: Update a service category

DELETE /service-categories/{id}: Delete a service category

POST /service-listings: Create a new service listing

GET /service-listings: List all service listings

GET /service-listings/{id}: Get a service listing by ID

PUT /service-listings/{id}: Update a service listing

DELETE /service-listings/{id}: Delete a service listing

GET /service-listings/search?query={query}: Search service listings

Chat Service:

POST /chats: Create a new chat between two user

GET /chats: List all the chats for a user

GET /chats/{id}: Get a chat by ID

POST /messages: send a new message

GET /messages/{chat_id}: Get messages for a given chat

4. Location Data:

For the MVP, let's start with a static list of markets (pre-seeded data) for our markets table and allow users to create custom addresses. This will help simplify development and can be extended later.
So we can assume that we will create a script that will populate the markets in the first place with our 3 big markets : Tokpa , Dantokpa, Missebo and then add other small markets there.

Next Steps

Confirm the Database Schema: Please review all of the data models and see if they match the goal you have in mind

Set Up Local Environment: I recommend that you install Python, Docker and an IDE to start coding. (we can help with that later if you are not familiar with that)

Create Basic FastAPI Projects: Create FastAPI projects for each service, using the schema we defined. I recommend to create all the service first and then we will implement the database schema in each project and define the models and the API endpoints.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to move forward!
